== Populating a database programmatically

The data in this CSV file (link:books.csv[]) consists of a list of titles, authors, and dates of important works of fiction. The same dataset was used in the earlier exercises.

The first task is to create a program that can read the data in the attached file and load it into a single-table database.

== Challenge: Design and modeling practice

Consider again the bibliographic database, note that there are multiple titles in the attached file (link:books.csv[]) written by a single author. In order to normalize this data, the author names should be moved into their own table and related to the book data through a relationship.

How can the authors data be related to the book titles? Can you create a program that will manage the normalization process at load time?
