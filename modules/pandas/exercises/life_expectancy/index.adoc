== Background

For this exercise we will use plotting to examine factors that may correlate with life expectancy.

The file `life_expectancy.csv` comes from https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who (column headings have been cleaned up to remove leading/trailing whitespace and to have consistent casing). It contains annual data on life expectancy and several other factors for several countries, spanning the years 2000-2015. It contains the following columns:

* Country: the name of the country
* Year: the year in which the data were obtained
* Status: "Developing" or "Developed"
* Life expectancy: the average lifespan of a resident of the country
* Adult mortality: probability that residents of this country will die between age 15 and age 60, expressed in terms of 1000 residents
* Infant deaths: number of annual infant deaths per 1000 people
* Alcohol: alcohol consumption per capita among residents 15 and older, expressed in liters of pure alcohol
* Percentage expenditure: expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product per capita
* Hepatitis B: percentage of 1-year-olds immunized against Hepatitis B
* Measles: number of measles cases reported per 1000 people
* BMI: average body mass index of the population
* Under-five deaths: number of deaths of children under the age of five per 1000 people
* Polio: percentage of 1-year-olds immunized against polio
* Total expenditure: government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure
* Diphtheria: percentage of 1-year-olds immunized against diptheria, tetanus, and pertussis
* HIV/AIDS: deaths due to HIV/AIDS (0-4 years) per 1000 live births
* GDP: gross domestic product per capita
* Population: population of the country
* Thinness 10-19 years: prevalence of thinness among people ages 10 to 19 as a percentage; a measure of malnourishment in adolescents
* Thinness 5-9 years: prevalence of thinness among people ages 5 to 9 as a percentage; a measure of malnourishment in children
* Income/composition of resources: Human Development Index in terms of income/composition of resources (index ranging from 0 to 1)
* Schooling: number of years of schooling

=== Template

A template script, `expectancy.py`, is provided. The script contains a function `parse_args()` which handles command-line arguments. It also contains import statements and an `+++if __name__ == "__main__":+++` statement to manage overall execution of the program.

== Problem statement

Write a function `plot_life_expectancy` that will create a joint plot with 2015 life expectancy as the x axis and a factor of the user's choosing as the y axis.

== Instructions

Please use the template to implement your solution to this exercise. Make sure your program is called `expectancy.py`.

=== `plot_life_expectancy()` function

Write a function called `plot_life_expectancy()`. Your function should take two arguments:

* a string containing the path to a CSV file containing life expectancy data
* a string containing the name of a column in the CSV file that has numeric values

Your function should read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame (do not hard-code the path to the file anywhere in your script!). It should create a Seaborn joint plot **using only the rows from the DataFrame where the year is 2015**. Use life expectancy as the x axis and the column specified by the second parameter of the function as the y axis. Use the `"Status"` column as the value for the `hue` argument.

__Hint: When you are not using Jupyter, one extra step is required to display a pyplot or seaborn plot.__

=== Docstrings

Please write a docstring for your `plot_life_expectancy()` function. For information on how to write docstrings, see https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1299872/pages/docstrings.

== Running your code

To run your program within the VS Code built-in terminal, first make sure you have opened (in VS Code) the directory where your program is saved. If necessary, you can go to the VS Code File menu and select "Open...â€‹" on macOS or "Open Folder..." on Windows, and navigate to the directory where your program is.

Then, open the VS Code built-in terminal. Type `python3` (on macOS) or `python` (on Windows) followed by a space and the name of your program. Include the path to `life_expectancy.csv` and a column name from this CSV file as command-line arguments. Here is an example:

----
python3 expectancy.py life_expectancy.csv "Adult mortality"
----
